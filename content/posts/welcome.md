<p>Hello. Welcome to the blog. Here you'll find notes I write to myself on my journey of learning as a software engineer, programmer, human being. These notes will be mostly short (and hopefully concise) -- things like explanations of solutions that have worked for me, particular problems about which I'm feeling extra curious, and meditations on learning and the software development process.<p>

<p>These days, the blogs and other sites that inspire me the most to write offer brevity, clarity, and precision. Resources such as <a href='https://seths.blog/' className='anchor' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Seth's Blog </a>give me something small and concrete and quickly manageable -- along with depth of meaning and possibility. I want this blog to offer something like that.</p> 

<p>Don't get me wrong: I love the long articles, too, as long as they're focused and accessible -- heading over to a place like <a href='https://martinfowler.com/' className='anchor' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>martinfowler.com </a> is usually a win when I want to dive deeper and stay deep. But when it comes to documenting my own process here, I'm going to keep things, for the most part, short and sweet. Like a quick flash of sunlight through the window.</p>
