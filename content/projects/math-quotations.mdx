<h2>Why I built it</h2>

---

<p>
  This app evolved out of my intention to practise asynchronous JavaScript with
  external APIs -- and then to practise that in conjunction with React hooks,
  namely useState() and useEffect(). Ultimately, the app is meant to provide
  inspiration through random quotations about math (and to be a loose reminder
  of the link between math and programming).
</p>

<h2>What it does</h2>

---

<p>
  It displays a random quotation about math with a random linear gradient
  background when the user clicks the 'click for a new quote' button, providing
  immense inspiration for the eyes and mind!
</p>

<h2>How I built it</h2>

---

<p>
  Initially, the app used fetch() to make a call to a public API that returned
  random programming quotations. Before using the React hooks, the changing
  background (the logic for which I reused from the Random Linear Gradient
  Generator) was not working in conjunction with the API call, so the background
  would change before the new quotation rendered.
</p>

<p>
  I then added the hooks to manage the state, run the api call when the state
  changed, and handle the background change in clear relation to the API call. I
  also switched from fetch() to using the Axios package for built-in JSON
  parsing.
</p>

<h2>How I tested it</h2>

---

<h2>What challenges I ran into</h2>

---

<p>
  After getting the app's central component set up and styling for large
  screens, I attempted to deploy the app on Vercel. The deployment was
  successful, but the app would only show a blank white screen. I spent
  countless hours looking for bugs, testing small changes across the central
  component, and finding nothing -- until I finally reminded myself to look more
  closely at the error messages in the console: There was a problem with making
  an API call to an endpoint that began with http rather than https.
</p>
<p>
  I couldn't find another (and more secure) public API that served random
  programing quotations, so I searched for one concerned with a related subject.
  As soon as I changed the API's URL, it worked like a charm.
</p>
<p>
  I also shot myself in the foot by designing the app with large screens only in
  mind. Determining the responsiveness with custom breakpoints within the Styled
  Components from large screen down to small screen felt clumsy, so I started
  the styling over and designed it with mobiles first in mind.
</p>

<h2>What I learned</h2>

---

I thought I had already learned this one: Read the
available error messages first, and read them closely. Also: I work more
efficiently with UI responsiveness when beginning with a mobile layout and
working my way up to large screens.

<h2>How I deploy it</h2>

---

<p>As a project on Vercel connected to a repository on GitHub.</p>

<h2>What's next for this project</h2>

---

<p>&bull; Make the degree of the linear gradient random as well.
<p>&bull; Find a way to make the contrast between the white text and the random background consistently accessible.
<p>&bull; Test it properly.</p>
