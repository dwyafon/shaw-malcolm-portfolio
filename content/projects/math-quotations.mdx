<h2>Why I built it</h2>

---

<p>
  This app evolved out of my intention to practise asynchronous with APIs -- and
  then to practise these things in conjunction with React hooks, namely
  useState() useEffect(). Ultimately, the app is meant to provide inspiration
  through random quotations about math (and to remind me of the link between
  math and programming).
</p>

<h2>What it does</h2>

---

<p>
  It displays a random quotation about math with a random linear gradient
  background when the user clicks the 'click for a new quote' button, providing
  immense inspiration for the eyes and mind!
</p>

<h2>How I built it</h2>

---

<p>
  The API call was originally done with fetch(), but I switched to using the
  Axios package for built-in JSON parsing.
