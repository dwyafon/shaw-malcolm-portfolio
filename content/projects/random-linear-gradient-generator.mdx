<h2>Why I built it</h2>

---

<p>
  When the blank white screen feels too vast and distracting, adding some colour
  can take one's mind off of the vastness and clear the head. Seeing
  new/unexpected colour combinations in the gradients can illuminate new UI
  possibilities.
</p>

<h2>What it does</h2>

---

<p>
  When the app first loads, a pre-set linear gradient is shown. The user can then
  generate a new random linear-gradient set at 45-degrees with a click of the button or by
  pressing the enter key.
</p>
<p>

</p>

<h2>How I built it</h2>

---

<p>
  I studied and practised vanilla JavaScript for many moons before touching a JS
  framework or library, and this app was built during my pre-React studies. I
  went with pure JS manipulating the DOM, simple CSS, and a bread and butter
  HTML document.
</p>
<p>
  The JS grabs the covering container, button, and h2 elements from the document
  with querySelector. When the click event is triggered, the changeGradient
  function is called, which runs two for-loops over an array of values from 0 to
  F to produce two different and random strings of hex values that are
  interpolated into a new linear gradient value. This new value is then applied
  as the background value for the covering container and the textContent value
  of the h2.
</p>

<h2>How I tested it</h2>

<h2>What challenges I ran into</h2>

---

<p>
  The main challenge was my initial thinking that something like this app was
  too simple, not worth building, that I needed to set my sights on something
  much larger and more complex. But I eventually regained my clarity and knew
  that there is a lot of opportunity and value in building simple things -- for
  myself and for others.
</p>

<h2>What I learned</h2>

---

<p>
  Choosing to stick with vanilla JavaScript for this project kept me grounded in
  fundamentals and reminded me of the power of simple DOM manipulation.
</p>

<p>
  This tiny app is a tool that I return to again and again when I'm quickly
  building something on the fly -- usually practising and learning something --
  and want a different background. I didn't realise when I built it that I would
  use it as much as I do.
</p>

<h2>How I deploy it</h2>

---

<p>This app is deployed through Vercel.</p>

<h2>What's next for this project</h2>

---

<p>&bull; Make the degree of the linear gradient randomly generated as well.</p>
<p>&bull; Test the app</p>
