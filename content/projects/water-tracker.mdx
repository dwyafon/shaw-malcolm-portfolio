<h2>Why I built it</h2>

---

<p>
  The problem I'm trying to solve: Dehydration while spending many hours in
  front of a screen. Dehydration can contribute to fatigue and depression, and
  drinking enough water is a simple and powerful way to support oneself. The app
  is meant to get the user thinking more about drinking water through goal
  setting and logging consumption throughout the day.
</p>

<h2>What it does</h2>

---

<p>
  The H2O Tracker helps the user to keep track of how much of a predetermined
  amount of water has been consumed over a predetermined amount of time.
</p>

<p>

<p>
  The user is prompted to input a water consumption goal in litres and the
  number of hours over which that water is to be consumed. The app then provides
  an average amount of water to be consumed per hour and asks for confirmation
  of these details. If the user clicks the 'No' button, the input fields
  maintain their amounts and wait for the user to make the necessary changes. If
  the user clicks the 'Yes' button, the user is taken to a new page with a timer
  and a console for logging water consumed. The user is instructed to click the
  'H2O' button each time the average amount of water has been consumed, which
  adds that amount to the total amount in the console.
</p>

<h2>How I built it</h2>

<p>
  The
  <a
    href='https://h2o-tracker.netlify.app/'
    target='_blank'
    rel='noopener noreferrer'
    className='anchor'
  >
    first version of this app
  </a>
  was built with vanilla JS, HTML and CSS. It was a good start, but it lacked
  responsiveness and speed.
</p>

<p>
  For this new version, I began with developing user stories, which led to a
  better understanding of what features were needed, which led to the
  development of the backlog (which I'm still working through). I then designed
  the UI mockups for the landing/form and tracker/timer pages with Figma.
</p>

<p>
  I chose the Next.js framework because I wanted fast server-side rendering, and
  I wanted the app to move from the landing page with the form to the tracking
  page with the timer. I trust in the Next.js routing set-up.
</p>

<p>Styling is done primarily with Styled Components and custom breakpoints.</p>

<h2>How I tested it</h2>

---

<h2>What challenges I ran into</h2>

---

<p>
  When starting on this new version, I wanted to immediately connect it to a
  PostgreSQL database (for user accounts), use Prisma as an ORM, and add user
  authentication. This backend focus, I realised, was premature and was
  distracting me from the frontend needs, so I started over and focused solely
  on a version that I could use as the base tool I had originally envisioned
  while continuing to improve the frontend and moving closer to starting on the
  backend.
</p>


<h2>What I learned</h2>

---

<p>
  Approaching the development of the app in a more agile way took more time up
  front, but it has paid off in overall clarity and efficiency of process.
</p>
<p></p>

<h2>How I deploy it</h2>

---

The H2O Tracker is deployed using Vercel for hosting, CI pipeline, and automated tests.

<h2>What's next for this project</h2>

---

<p>&bull; Testing the app.</p>

<p>
  &bull; A gentle reminder to the user when the average amount of water to drink
  has not been met.
</p>

<p>&bull; Content for the T&C's, Guidelines, and About pages.</p>

<p>
  &bull; User accounts using a PostgreSQL database and Prisma for object
  relational mapping -- I want to give users the option to record their daily,
  weekly, monthly, and yearly water intake.
</p>

<p>&bull; User authentication</p>
