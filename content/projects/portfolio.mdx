<h2>What it does</h2>

---

It showcases my projects and process, as well as my voice as a writer-programmer-learner.

<h2>How I built it</h2>

---

<p>
  I began with a
  <a
    href='https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-tailwindcss'
    className='anchor'
    target='_blank'
    rel='noreferrer noopener'
  >
    Next.js + Tailwind CSS example
  </a>
  that includes a starter tailwind.config.js file. I had never used Tailwind before
  and had heard about how it can help to speed up styling -- it definitely can. I
  turned often to the
  <a
    href='https://tailwindcss.com/docs'
    className='anchor'
    target='_blank'
    rel='noreferrer noopener'
  >
    Tailwind docs
  </a>
  to develop a grasp of the syntax, and once that was familiar the process of styling
  components and making changes felt quick and efficient.
</p>

<p>
  Both the blog entries and the project descriptions (such as what you're
  reading right now) utilise Next.js dynamic routing, with the slug content for
  both areas coming from separate sets of Markdown files. Tailwind is highly
  customisable, and I took advantage of how it supports the use of JSX and its
  own class names within Markdown files. The Markdown files themselves utilise
  frontmatter that is passed to a slug during the process of a dynamic page
  being generated.
</p>

<p>
  I used CSS Grid for the overall layout structure and Flexbox for more granular
  positioning, CSS Modules and SASS for global Markdown styling passed to the
  blog post and project slugs, and @font-face to add one consistent and locally
  accessible font. I downloaded the Inter font from Google Fonts and converted
  it from ttf to woff and woff2 files with
  <a
    href='https://transfonter.org/'
    className='anchor'
    target='_blank'
    rel='noreferrer noopener'
  >
    transfonter
  </a>.
</p>

<p>The portfolio's light-dark theme toggling is based on Tailwind's <a href='https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode' className='anchor' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>dark mode feature</a> and the <a href='https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes' className='anchor' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>next-themes </a>package which comes with a ThemeProvider that is wrapped around the application's central Component. The next-themes useTheme() hook is integrated with the toggle, which makes the application globally aware of the theme being 'light' or 'dark'.

<h2>How I tested it</h2>

---

<p>
  I've begun testing with Lighthouse before I use the Testing Library for
  testing the JavaScript specifically. Initially, the app scores highest for SEO
  and lowest for performance, with an overall score of 87. Much more testing to
  follow.
</p>

<h2>What challenges I ran into</h2>

---

</p>I was used to using Styled Components, so getting used to the Tailwind syntax slowed me down at first. Once the syntax was familiar, styling felt quite easy and more flexible in certain ways -- for example, using a quick 'mx' class for horizontal spacing to shift components felt like a gift.</p>

<p>
  Deciding on the best approach to the light-dark toggle and trying different
  implementations felt like rabbit holes initially, until I discvovered the easy
  combo of Tailwind's dark mode feature and next-themes.
</p>

<p>
  I also struggled with linking the images from the project markdown frontmatter
  with the image files. Originally, I placed the image files in an image folder
  inside the Public folder. The pathnames in the frontmatter were correct, and
  the images loaded on the local server, but the deployment on Vercel kept
  throwing 404s for the images. Moving the project images straight into the
  Public folder and changing the paths in the frontmatter solved the problem,
  but I'd rather keep the images in their own sub-directory. More exploring
  there to be done.
</p>

<h2>What I learned</h2>

---

<p>
  Along with first steps with Tailwind, I learned, or relearned really, that
  Next.js is super fast. I also discovered that MDX really opens up the Markdown
  game, and that Markdown files play really nicely with Next.js routing.
</p>

<h2>How I deploy it</h2>

---

<p>
  The portfolio is deployed as a project on Vercel with a link to the repository
  on Github. Vercel uses its own CI pipeline with automated tests and sends me
  emails with reports on the success or failure of attempted deployments after
  I've pushed changes to the remote repository.
</p>

<h2>What's next for this project</h2>

---

<p>
  &bull; I need to test the JavaScript. The Testing Library will be my toolbox
  for that. Once that is done, I'll update this page with details on what I
  found and learned.
</p>
<p>
  &bull; Improve the colour contrast in both light and dark mode --
  accessibility across the board is important to me
</p>
<p>&bull; Clean up my use of Tailwind with custom classes.</p>
